## Overview 

This single page web app is built using Svelte and consumes data from Harvard's Art Museum API. It allows a visitor to click through all the image records contained in the API, presenting the images in a pseudo gallery. The goal of this project was to simulate a take home tech challenge where we would be tasked to build an app in a language/framework that we may not already be familiar with, in 48-72 hours. This was my first time writing a web app in Svelte, and so there was some initial hurdles getting aquainted with the syntax, and how it implements async, if/else blocks, and for each mapping.

### Future Iterations 

I would like to come back and learn how to write tests for a Svelte application. Additionally, there is a lot more to be seen and consumed by this API so it would be cool to have a more robust viewing experience and allow visitors the option to control what they see
